# Predicting-Customer-Churn-with-Logistic-Regression
Machine Learning Project on Customer Churn with Logistic Regression
OPredicting Customer Churn with Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using logistic regression. The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains information on customer demographics, account information, and usage patterns.
Data Source

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle at the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

The dataset contains 7,043 rows and 21 columns of data on customer demographics, account information, and usage patterns for a telecommunications company. The target variable in this dataset is "Churn", which indicates whether or not a customer has churned.
Steps Performed in the Data Evaluation

    Data Loading and Exploration: The data was loaded into Python using the pandas library and explored using various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques such as summary statistics, data visualization, and checking for missing values.

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The data was cleaned by addressing missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types. The data was also preprocessed by encoding categorical variables and scaling continuous variables.

    Feature Selection: Feature selection was performed using various methods such as correlation analysis, univariate feature selection, and recursive feature elimination.

    Model Training and Evaluation: The logistic regression model was trained using the training set and evaluated using the test set. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

    Model Interpretation: The model coefficients were interpreted to identify the features that were most important in predicting customer churn.

Overall, this project demonstrates how logistic regression can be used to predict customer churn and provides insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn in the telecommunications industry.
